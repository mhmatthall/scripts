# scripts

## To-do

- Add a common file for shared functionality
  - Windows desktop notifications
  - User prompt with validation
- Combine `pomo` with `timed_lock`, because I like the countdown notifications but also the flexibility in timings
  - Consider whether percentage-based notif spacing is better than just fixed gaps. Length of timer would also need more reminders than, say, a 5 minute one
- Add launch option/flag/params:
  - to set light/dark mode icons
  - for the combined (see above) `timed_lock`, whether to show reminder notifs or not
- Create script to 'install' scripts -- basically just add start menu shortcuts
